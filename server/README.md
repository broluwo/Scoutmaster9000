Scoutmaster 9000 : Server
======
##Overview
Scoutmaster 9000 is a scouting system for the [FIRST Robotics Competition](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc) created by [Team 449, The Blair Robot Project](http://robot.mbhs.edu/). It is a replacement for Scout449 (our old scouting program), which was not flexible enough and had become difficult to maintain. The name is a reference to the Gruntmaster 9000, a theoretical upgraded version of the flagship product from the [Dilbert TV series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert_%28TV_series%29).
>Dilmom: Why don't you call your product the Gruntmaster 6000?  
>Dilbert: What kind of product do you see when you imagine a Gruntmaster 6000?  
>Dilmom: Well it's a stripped-down version of the Gruntmaster 9000 of course. But it's software-upgradeable.
